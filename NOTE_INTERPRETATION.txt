#NOTE TO SELF

Choice was associated with ROIs assigned two communities (4 and 5) that were the same as reward & punishment BUT community number was flipped. 

Choice 
	- Insula and Thalamus (Community 4)
	- Lateral OFC (Community 5)

Reward and Punishment
 	- Insula and Thalamus (Community 5)
	- Lateral OFC (Community 4)

SINCE COMMUNITY NUMBER is not ordinal in any way -- these results were flipped

IN THE PAPER, I reversed these communities during choice
