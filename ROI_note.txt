#NOTE TO SELF

When I make the betaseries ROI file, I mislabelled the oral_somatosensory_cortex_R as _L and vice versa. 

Rather than repull the timeseries, I have labelled the columns to reflect the ROI location. 

For all other ROIs, results are shown for L then R hemisphere. For oral_somat_cortex, results are R then L.
